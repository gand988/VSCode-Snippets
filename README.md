# VSCode-Snippets
All my (small) collection of custom snippets for VS Code.

## Placeholder 
This is my most used placeholder size for images, 350x150.

## PlaceholderCustom
Created for Skat, with this snipet you enter the width & height that you need

## Placeholder500x200
Just a random one.

## Future plan
See if people want the <img> tag and maybe add the Class attribute.
